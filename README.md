### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<As an artist I've always loved the challenge of turning a blank canvas into art. In my search for the ultimate masterpiece, Iâ€™ve found this new form of expression: <Progr@mming!>
I learned that my canvas would no longer be finite, that my colors would now be lines of code, and that by combining them would result in functional works of art!
